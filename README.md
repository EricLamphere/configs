# Dotfiles & Configs
Various personal dotfiles and scripts to help manage my workflow

## Notes
* Each subdirectory in the dotfiles directory contains files/folders _exactly_ how they should be named
* Most (if not all) files and directories should be symlinked into the home directory (`~` on mac os)
