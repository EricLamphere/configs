# Micro
Micro config setup notes

## Setup
Things I had to do manually with my config setup:
1. Make sure there wasn't any custom keybinding mapped to option+down or option+up
2. Disable all ctrl+left/right/up/down keybindings in System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mission Control
3. Update EDITOR environment variable in ~/.zshrc to micro
