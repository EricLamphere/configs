## Sync Scripts
These scripts are used for syncing dotfiles to git. These typically have lived in a `~/cron_scripts/` directory

* Personal repos should live in a `~/Personal/` directory
* See `sync_dotfiles.sh` to see where other dotfiles should live (`cp` commands)
* Obsidian notes should live in a `~/vaults/notes/` directory
